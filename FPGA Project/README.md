# FA22 FPGA Final Project -- Audio Controller

This is the repository for Chris Khoury and Ben Promisel's FPGA FA22 Project. 
The goal for this project is to read in an audio signal from the I2S2 PMOD, filter the audio signal according to some user inputs (buttons, knobs), and output the filtered audio signal back through the PMOD.
